Hello everyone! We are Team Java Juggernauts, and our project is Medicine Tracker.


A medicine tracker for Alzheimer's disease is a digital or physical tool designed to help patients, 
nurse caregivers, and family members manage and monitor medication schedules. It has a user-friendly 
medication system application that lets Alzheimer’s disease patients have timely and personalized 
medication reminders to ensure consistent intake of their medicine, reduces the risk of missed or 
double doses, and a system application that lets Alzheimer’s disease caregivers track their patient’s 
medication history. Advanced trackers may include features like medication interaction alerts, progress 
tracking, and secure sharing of medication records with caregivers, nurses, and family members, 
enhancing overall treatment adherence and effectiveness.
